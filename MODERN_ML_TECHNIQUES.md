# üöÄ Modern ML Techniques for F1 Predictions

## Current State
- **Ensemble Model**: 86% accuracy, 1.34s MAE
- **5 Models**: GB, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, RF

## üß† Next-Level Techniques to Implement

### 1. **Deep Learning with Transformers** (Expected: +10-15% accuracy)
```python
# Use attention mechanisms to capture complex race dynamics
from transformers import TimeSeriesTransformerModel

class F1Transformer:
    """
    - Attention on driver-track interactions
    - Multi-head attention for weather-performance correlation
    - Position embeddings for grid ‚Üí finish mapping
    """
```

**Why it works**: Transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies and complex interactions between features.

### 2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** (Expected: +8-12% accuracy)
```python
import torch_geometric
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class F1GraphNetwork:
    """
    Nodes: Drivers
    Edges: Head-to-head battle history
    Features: Performance metrics
    
    - Model overtaking probabilities
    - Team dynamics (teammate effects)
    - Track position importance
    """
```

**Why it works**: F1 is inherently relational - drivers interact, teams share data, positions matter for overtaking.

### 3. **Bayesian Neural Networks** (Uncertainty Quantification)
```python
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

class BayesianF1Predictor:
    """
    - Probabilistic predictions with confidence intervals
    - Handles uncertainty from crashes/mechanical failures
    - Better calibrated confidence scores
    """
```

**Why it works**: F1 has high uncertainty (crashes, failures). Bayesian methods quantify this naturally.

### 4. **Multi-Task Learning** (Expected: +5-8% accuracy)
```python
class MultiTaskF1Model:
    """
    Simultaneously predict:
    1. Finishing position
    2. Lap times
    3. Pit stop timing
    4. DNF probability
    5. Points scored
    
    Shared representations improve all tasks
    """
```

**Why it works**: These tasks are related - learning them together improves feature representations.

### 5. **Meta-Learning (Few-Shot Learning)** 
```python
from learn2learn import MAML

class F1MetaLearner:
    """
    - Quickly adapt to new tracks
    - Learn from just 1-2 races at new circuits
    - Adapt to regulation changes
    """
```

**Why it works**: F1 constantly changes (new tracks, regulations). Meta-learning adapts quickly.

### 6. **Reinforcement Learning for Strategy**
```python
import stable_baselines3

class F1StrategyAgent:
    """
    State: Race position, tire age, gap to rivals
    Actions: Pit now, stay out, push/conserve
    Reward: Final position improvement
    
    Learns optimal strategy through simulation
    """
```

**Why it works**: Strategy is sequential decision-making - perfect for RL.

### 7. **Ensemble of Ensembles (Stacking)**
```python
class StackedF1Predictor:
    """
    Level 1: Current ensemble
    Level 2: Neural network ensemble
    Level 3: Meta-learner combines all
    
    Each level captures different patterns
    """
```

### 8. **Temporal Fusion Transformer**
```python
from pytorch_forecasting import TemporalFusionTransformer

class F1TemporalFusion:
    """
    - Variable selection networks
    - Static covariates (driver skill)
    - Time-varying inputs (form, weather)
    - Interpretable attention weights
    """
```

**Why it works**: Designed for time series with mixed inputs - perfect for F1.

### 9. **Conformal Prediction**
```python
from mapie import MapieRegressor

class ConformalF1Predictor:
    """
    - Guaranteed prediction intervals
    - "Driver will finish between P3-P5 with 95% confidence"
    - Adapts interval width based on uncertainty
    """
```

### 10. **Neural ODEs**
```python
from torchdiffeq import odeint

class F1NeuralODE:
    """
    - Model continuous race evolution
    - Lap-by-lap performance degradation
    - Smooth predictions through race
    """
```

## üîß Quick Implementation Example

### Temporal Fusion Transformer (Start Here!)
```python
# Install
pip install pytorch-forecasting pytorch-lightning

# Implementation
import pytorch_forecasting as pf
from pytorch_forecasting import TemporalFusionTransformer

# Prepare data in long format
training_data = pf.TimeSeriesDataSet(
    data,
    time_idx="race_number",
    target="position",
    group_ids=["driver_id"],
    static_categoricals=["team", "driver_id"],
    time_varying_known_reals=["weather_temp", "track_temp"],
    time_varying_unknown_reals=["qualifying_position", "tire_age"],
)

# Create model
tft = TemporalFusionTransformer.from_dataset(
    training_data,
    lstm_layers=2,
    attention_head_size=4,
    dropout=0.1,
    hidden_continuous_size=16,
)

# Train
trainer = pl.Trainer(gpus=1, max_epochs=100)
trainer.fit(tft, train_dataloader=train_dataloader)

# Get interpretable predictions
predictions = tft.predict(test_data, return_attention=True)
```

## üö® Why These Work for F1

1. **High Dimensionality**: Modern deep learning handles 100s of features
2. **Sequential Nature**: Races unfold over time - perfect for RNNs/Transformers
3. **Interaction Effects**: Drivers battle each other - GNNs model this
4. **Uncertainty**: Crashes happen - Bayesian methods quantify this
5. **Limited Data**: Only 24 races/year - meta-learning helps

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Implement Temporal Fusion first
2. **Validation Strategy**: Use leave-one-race-out CV
3. **Feature Engineering Still Matters**: Deep learning isn't magic
4. **Ensemble Everything**: Combine neural + tree models
5. **Monitor Overfitting**: F1 has limited data

## üèÅ Next Steps

1. Install PyTorch and pytorch-forecasting
2. Implement Temporal Fusion Transformer
3. A/B test against current ensemble
4. Add GNN for driver interactions
5. Stack everything together
